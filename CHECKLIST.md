- [ ] POST /api/v1/auth/logout

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Nonces expire after 5 minutes
- [ ] Nonces are one-time use
- [ ] JWT tokens have proper expiration
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents spam
- [ ] No sensitive data in responses

### Documentation Delivered
- [ ] How to test the authentication
- [ ] Any changes from original spec
- [ ] Known issues or limitations
