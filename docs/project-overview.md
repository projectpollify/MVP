# Pollify.net Project Overview

## Vision
Pollify is a Cardano-based discussion platform that enables authentic discourse through blockchain-verified identities while respecting user privacy preferences.

## Core Problem We're Solving
Current discussion platforms force users into a binary choice: complete anonymity or full identity disclosure. This leads to:
- Toxic behavior from anonymous accounts
- Privacy concerns from real-name policies
- No middle ground for contextual identity

## Our Solution: Three User Modes

### 1. True Self Mode
- **Use Case**: Professional discussions, official statements, building reputation
- **Identity**: Fully verified through Cardano blockchain
- **Features**: Complete access, reputation building, verified badge

### 2. Alias/Shadow Mode
- **Use Case**: Regular participation without full exposure
- **Identity**: Consistent pseudonym tied to wallet
- **Features**: Most features available, anonymous but accountable

### 3. Soul Mode
- **Use Case**: Private browsing, sensitive topics
- **Identity**: Completely anonymous, read-only
- **Features**: Can read and browse, cannot interact

## Technical Architecture

### Why Cardano?
- Decentralized identity verification
- Immutable reputation system
- Native token for engagement rewards
- Strong community alignment

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Node.js + TypeScript**: Industry standard, large talent pool
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, scalable, JSONB for flexibility
- **Next.js**: SEO-friendly, great developer experience
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database access
